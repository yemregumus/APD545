**Requirements**

**Receive Price:** Receive the price value for each instrument from the user to create an object of that instrument.

**Display Information:** Display How to Play, How to Fix, Pitch type, and Price information for the most expensive instrument.

**Display Instrument Names:** Display the names of all instruments in descending order of price.

**Family Sound Display:** Receive an instrument family name from the user and display how each instrument of that given family makes sound.

**Demonstrate Comparable Interface:** Use the Comparable interface to find the instrument object with the highest price and sort them.

**Array of Objects:** Demonstrate the use of an array of objects to hold objects of each concrete type of musical instrument.

**Proper Modularization:** Demonstrate proper modularization of code, Java industry standard with proper comments, indentations, and naming convention.

**Header Information:** Include Workshop, Name, ID, and other information as commented at the beginning of your main class file.

**Test Application:** Test your application for multiple runs with different price values for all instruments.

**MVC Design Pattern:** Ensure your code follows the MVC design pattern.


**Sample Output:**
Enter the price for Drum: 349.00

Enter the price for Flute: 74.90

Enter the price for Guitar: 199.00

Enter the price for Harp: 255.00

Enter the price for Xylophone: 49.00

--: Requirement 2 :--

The most expensive instrument is: Drum

Drumâ€™s cost is: $349.0

Drum is played: by hitting the membrane

Drum fixing: replace the membrane

Drum pitch type: Sonic pitch

--: Requirement 3 :--

Instruments in price descending order:

[Xylophone][Flute][Guitar][Harp][Drum]

--: Requirement 4 :--

Enter an instrument family: Percussion

Drum makes sound vibrating stretched membrane.

Xylophone makes sound through resonators.

Process finished with exit code 0
